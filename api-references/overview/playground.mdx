## Playground

Interactive API Playground is a feature developed to facilitate your quick test
of API endpoints right from your browser. It calls the endpoints in
[Development environment](https://home.dev.cobo.com/). You need to first
create an account at Cobo Custody Development environment, then set up the
corresponding API-KEY and API-SECRET. This article explains how to do that.

The following assumes you've already created your account with Cobo Custody in
Development environment. You've followed [the tutorial](/get-started/overview/quickstart) to
generate your API-KEY and API-SECRET. And you've set your API-KEY in Cobo
Custody web interface.

<Warning>API Playground only supports the Development environment.
It serves as a testing ground for developers to browse and experience API endpoints.
For security purposes, NEVER input your API-SECRET of the Production environment.</Warning>
