## Introduction

This article explains how Cobo's WaaS Service authenticates API clients.
If you are using one of the five WaaS SDKs provided by Cobo, you can skip this
article because the SDKs already encapsulate the authentication mechanism for
you. If you don't use the SDKs, you would have to implement the authentication
by yourself, this article explains how.

[To be supplemented with details]

## Create API key

To ensure secure access to your crypto assets under Cobo Custody via APIs,
Cobo mandates the use of ECDSA signatures for authentication in all API calls.
Access to the API is denied without proper authentication.

Generate and manage API keys effortlessly using the Cobo-provided SDK ([here](https://github.com/CoboGlobal)).
Here's a sample Python SDK:

```python Python
from cobo_custody.signer.local_signer import generate_new_key
api_secret, api_key = generate_new_key()
print(api_secret)
print(api_key)
```

<Warning>
api_secret is your private key and should be stored securely.

api_key is your public key and needs to be set in your custody account.
</Warning>

## Test API Key

Once you've added your API key to your Custody account (see [How to set API key on Custody in the quickstart section](/waas/quickstart)),
we provide two methods to test whether your API key has been configured successfully.

**Test API key by SDKs:**

```python Python
signer = LocalSigner("YOUR_API_SECRET")
client = Client(signer=signer, env=DEVELOP_ENV, debug=True)
res = client.get_account_info()
```

**Test API key by Playground:**

We also provide an exciting API interaction tool called Playground,
which makes testing APIs a breeze. To learn how to use Playground, refer to the([Interactive API Playground](/waas/playground)) section.
