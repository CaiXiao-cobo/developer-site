If you have already opened an account on Cobo Custody and obtained an API key ([How to get API key](/mpc-custody/authentication)),
all you need to do is enter your API key in the "PRIVATE-KEY" field in the Playground.
The "BIZ-API-KEY", "BIZ-API-SIGNATURE", and "BIZ-API-NONCE" parameters are automatically calculated by the authentication SDK
and transmitted in the header of the HTTP request. Thus, the user does not need to input them.
The user can fill in the rest of the API parameters and click on "Send Request" to view the API response.
Currently, the API Playground only supports the development environment.

<Warning>API Playground only supports the development environment.
         It serves as a testing ground for developers to browse and experience API endpoints.
         For security purposes, never input your private key of the production environment.</Warning>
