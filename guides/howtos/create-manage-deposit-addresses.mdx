## Overview

User deposit addresses are commonly used by retail-facing platforms to receive funds from external users. These addresses are assigned to each user to easily distinguish the source of deposit transactions.

With Cobo Wallet-as-a-Service, you can create and manage deposit addresses for your applications in both **Custodial Wallet** and **MPC Wallet**.

## Create Addresses

You can create up to 200 addresses by using [Cobo SDKs](https://github.com/CoboGlobal) and corresponding APIs ([Custodial Wallet API](/api-references/custody-wallet/new_addresses), [MPC Wallet API](/api-references/mpc-wallet/mpc_generate_addresses) )

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
#Custodial Wallet
client.batch_new_deposit_address("GETH",1)
#MPC Wallet
mpc_client.generate_addresses("GETH",1)
```
```java Java
//Cusotidal Wallet
client.newAddresses("GETH", 1, false);
//MPC Wallet
mpcClient.generateAddresses("GETH", 1);
```
</CodeGroup><br />
<Accordion title="View Response">
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": {
    "coin": "GETH",
    "address": "0xec323f3743b96e020c234c216fa650f96b66fc9d"
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

You need to specify the `Coin` field in the format of **Chain Code_Token Code** (e.g., “ETH_USDT”, “TRON_USDC”). Token Code is not required for native coins (e.g., “BTC”, “ETH”). You can query the types of coins supported by your wallet via the [Get Supported Coins](/api-references/custody-wallet/get_supported_coins).

These addresses can be used to receive coins under the same chain, and EVM addresses can be used to receive coins for all EVM-compatible chains.

For BTC, Cobo supports both _segwit_ (3 address) and _native_segwit_ (bc1 address) addresses. You can input “True”  in the `native_segwit` field to generate bc1 addresses.

Please make sure you have added coins on Cobo Custody Web before creating any deposit addresses via API.

## Manage Addresses

You can view your address list using the Get Address History ([Cusotidal Wallet API](/api-references/custody-wallet/address_history), [MPC Wallet API](/api-references/mpc-wallet/mpc_list_addresses)).
This API allows you to retrieve addresses by coin types. Each API request can retrieve up to 20 addresses, in either ascending or descending order.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
#Custodial Wallet
client.get_address_history("GETH")
#MPC Wallet
mpc_client.list_addresses("GETH")
```
```java Java
//Cusotidal Wallet
client.getAddressHistory("GETH");
//MPC Wallet
mpcClient.listAddresses("GETH");
```

## Manage Balance and Transactions

**In Custodial Wallet**, you can query the wallet balance using the [Get Account Details](/api-references/custody-wallet/org_info) , where the balance of each type of coin will be returned in the balance field of the response.
Note that because Cobo will automatically aggregate funds in deposit addresses, the balance in a deposit address may not reflect the actual balance of the selected type of coin.

<Tip>In Custodial Wallet, tokens deposited into these addresses will undergo automated aggregation (token sweep) by Cobo. You are exempt from the necessity to pre-fund or fund transaction fees for your deposit addresses. This translates into substantial savings in both development and operational efforts for your team.</Tip>
