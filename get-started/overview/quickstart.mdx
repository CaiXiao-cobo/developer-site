The tutorial shows how to quickly get started with using Cobo WaaS with it's
provided SDKs. This tutorial is run on the [Development
environment](https://home.dev.cobo.com/), which is dedicated for developers
to develop and test their applications. Cobo's Development environment is a
completely separate from [Production
environment](https://home.custody.cobo.com/), which means the associated
accounts, API credentials etc. are completely isolated.

You can try out the tutorial on Development enviroment. When you run your applications
on Production environment, most of the experiences will be the same, except for
the supported coins will be different and the security measures will be
stricter in production.

## Create an account

To begin using Cobo's WaaS services, the first step is to create your account at https://home.dev.cobo.com/#/login.
After creating an account, you gain access to a personalized Dashboard where you can manage your API keys, coins, and more.

If you do not have an account yet, please reach out to us at https://www.cobo.com/waas.

## Choose SDK

Cobo provides SDKs in five programming languages to help you implement your
application. You can choose from five available SDKs.

The tutorial uses the Python SDK.

## Create API key

Generate your API key and secret using the Cobo-provided SDK
([here](https://github.com/CoboGlobal)).
Here's a sample Python code:

```python Python
from cobo_custody.signer.local_signer import generate_new_key
api_secret, api_key = generate_new_key()
print(api_secret)
print(api_key)
```

<Warning>
api_secret is your private key and should be stored securely.

api_key is your public key and needs to be set in your WaaS account via Cobo Custody web interface.
</Warning>

## Setting on custody

After creating the API key and setting up an account on Custody, you will gain access to the APIs Dashboard.

Next, insert the API key you generated using the SDK into the 'Public Key' field.

After API key's status is Active

Now that all the settings are done, you can use our SDKs to make API calls.

## Test API by SDKs

```python Python
# input your API_SECRET
signer = LocalSigner("YOUR_API_SECRET")
client = Client(signer=signer, env=DEVELOP_ENV, debug=True)
res = client.get_account_info()
```
