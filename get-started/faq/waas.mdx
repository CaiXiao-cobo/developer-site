<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What do `coin`, `display_code`, and `description` separately mean in the interface?">
    `coin` is Cobo’s internal coin code, which uniquely identifies each coin, while `display_code ` is the ticker symbol of
    a coin (not unique, changeable, for reference only ). ` description ` indicates the full name of a coin (not unique,
    changeable, for reference only ).For example: Tron was an ERC-20 token before launching its own mainnet and token. The
    ERC-20 and Tron mainnet tokens would share the same `display_code` and `description`, but have different `coin` values.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do `amount` and `abs_amount` mean in the interface?">
    In the cryptocurrency world, each coin has a smallest unit. For example, Bitcoin’s smallest unit is Satoshi; 1 BTC =
    100,000,000 Satoshi. Cobo expresses amounts in terms of the smallest unit of the coin. This is to avoid problems caused
    by the misuse of floating numbers. Therefore, when transferring 1 BTC, the amount in the transaction is 100,000,000. In
    other words, `abs_amount` is used to indicate the same thing in real numbers. Clients may configure according to their
    own preferences. The conversion relation between them is: **abs_amount = amount / pow(10, decimal)**

 <Accordion title="How to check the current stuck transaction? ">
    You may use this interface GET /v1/custody/pending_transactions/ for inquiries, or you can go to the web end - Wallet - Transactions to view it.
 </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What functionality is  API used to implement.">
    API withdrawal is mainly for exchanges and large institutions, and it is done through backend code without the need for human intervention.
    Web-end withdrawal requires manual operation and will also go through a complete risk control process.
 </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to verify Cobo's callback push, which requires Cobo's Pub key? Is this signature verification necessary? How to obtain the Pub key?">
     Hello, signature verification and IP whitelist are recommended to be efficient when accepting callbacks, which can simply and greatly improve security.
     Cobo signature verification can be obtained on the hosting web management interface - wallet - API callback page. How to verify can refer to the document: https://www.cobo.
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="We cannot receive callback push. What is the export IP for Cobo's callback push?">
    Cobo Prod export IP: 54.201.57.0, please add it to your whitelist to receive Cobo’s callback push.
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="Where to obtain the API public and private keys？">
    Hello, from the perspective of security, Cobo uses the ECDSA signature algorithm for verification.
    It is recommended that you generate the public and private keys locally, and Cobo will not know/save your private key.
    After you generate the public and private keys locally, you can maintain the public key in the web management interface [Wallet - API].
    For private key generation, signature and signature verification, please refer to the Sample provided by Cobo: https://github.com/CoboGlobal/, and for API related documents, please refer to: https://www.cobo.com/developers/custodial-wallet/introduction
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title=" Is there a maximum limit for API callback pushes？">
    Hello, the maximum number of pushes for API transaction notifications is 14 times. The interval time is in an increasing state.
    It is 10 minutes at the beginning, and it will increase with time later, 1 hour, 2 hours, etc.
 </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The necessity of configuring secondary callbacks">
    Your company has configured an API_KEY in the security risk control, but has not configured the [Secondary Callback Server Address]. API link: https://doc.custody.cobo.com/#9a7cef1ae8
    Considering the single-point risk faced by a single API server, we strongly recommend that you enable and configure a secondary confirmation callback internally, and maintain a separate callback server.
    First, risk isolation, multiple servers are used for secondary confirmation.
    Second, enabling the secondary callback is also a very effective internal security risk control measure. Once the secondary callback has an exception, Cobo's 24/7 customer service will also promptly remind you to check whether there is an exception in your internal business logic, provide early warning, and identify and block related abnormal withdrawals earlier, enhancing the security protection of your asset withdrawal.
    The password of your custodial account, 2FA and Cobo Auth verification, ensure the multiple confirmations of your account and the initiation of withdrawals on the web end. Maintaining a separate secondary callback URL can ensure the multiple security of your internal server, so from a security perspective, we strongly recommend that you enable it.
 </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the main consideration for the secondary callbacks? Is it cost considerations or business maintenance?">
        As for the secondary callbacks，we consider the risk isolation. Based on our historical experience in custodial services, maintaining a server with business logic poses a significant risk.
        We suggest you enable callbacks based on multi-layered risk control considerations.
        From the perspective of your platform, your platform has a large trading volume. For the withdrawal behavior of the platform, it is necessary to carry out secondary withdrawal confirmation. '
        We have also served many platform-type customers. From a safety perspective, we hope that you will conduct a more comprehensive internal assessment.
 </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will Cobo proactively rollback failed transactions?">
    Considering forward compatibility, Cobo will not actively callback for currently failed transactions (callbacks will be pushed for pending and successful ones), and it depends on the customer to poll the withdrawal request status.
    There could be various reasons for withdrawal failures:
    Network issues, insufficient balance, illegal addresses, etc., which are directly returned errors.

    (The following failures are exceptions)
    After the withdrawal is initiated successfully, the withdrawal is confirmed by a secondary callback as deny/no response.
    Web/AUTH manual review rejection.
    Some transaction information is filled in incorrectly, such as memo errors, the other party's address has on-chain verification and cannot be on-chain.
 </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I retrieve pending transactions using the custody/pending_transactions/ interface?">
     1. Need to check if it is enabled: ""Transaction Notification - Includes Block Confirmation Number Status"" in API callback https://doc.custody.cobo.com/#913378a003
     2. If 1 is enabled, if it is the TRON chain of the transaction, the confirmation on the chain may be too fast, so it is not in pending, it is in the successful tx table, you can use a coin type with a longer pending for joint debugging，such as ETH, BTC."
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="How to generate an API key? What format is the public key required by the wallet API?">
    It needs in hex format. You can use the API Key private key (API SECRET) generated locally, sign the data with the private key using ECDSA, and hex encode the binary result.
    This generates the final signature used for verification with the API server (you can refer to the Cobo routine: https://github.com/cobowallet/
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="Are all API keys valid for 90 days? Can they be made permanently valid?">
    When not bound to an IP whitelist, the validity period for each key is 90 days. After binding to an IP whitelist, the key is permanently valid
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="Why can't I configure the API KEY">
    Please check if you have administrator privileges, as only administrators can configure.
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion title="Reasons for API signature verification failure">
    "There are several main reasons for signature verification failure, and you can also exclude the first few on your side to see:
    1. Have you maintained your public key on the correct environment (Prod/Sandbox) Custody Web? And is the API Key type correct? (There are three types of API Keys, ""query"", ""withdrawal and query"", ""operation and query"", please make sure you are using the correct type of API Key)
    2. Have you used the correct HOST:
    Sandbox: https://api.dev.cobo.com, corresponding web page: Sandbox: https://home.dev.cobo.com/
    Production: https://api.custody.cobo.com, corresponding web page: Prod: https://home.custody.cobo.com/
