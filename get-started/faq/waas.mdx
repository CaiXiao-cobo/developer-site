## Coin Management
### How do I query the withdrawal fees?
    <Expandable title="Answer">
        <ResponseField >
         The withdrawal fees may fluctuate based on how busy a blockchain network is. You can refer to the `abs_estimate_fee` field
          of the [GET /v1/custody/coin_info](https://www.cobo.com/developers/api-references/custody-wallet/coin_info) endpoint to check the estimated withdrawal fees associated with a Custodial Wallet. 
          For an MPC Wallet, please use the [GET /v1/custody/mpc/estimate_fee/](https://www.cobo.com/developers/api-references/mpc-wallet/mpc_estimate_fee) endpoint instead.
</ResponseField>
  </Expandable>

### What do `amount` and `abs_amount` stand for in the interface?
<Expandable title="Answer">
   <ResponseField >In the realm of cryptocurrencies, each coin possesses a smallest unit. 
   For instance, a satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Each Bitcoin equals 100 million satoshis (i.e., 100,000,000). 
   Cobo denominates amount in terms of the smallest unit specific to each cryptocurrency to prevent complications associated with the misuse of floating point numbers. 
   If you transfer 1 Bitcoin, for instance, the `amount` will be displayed as 100,000,000 and the `abs_amount` will be 1. 
   This conversion is calculated using the formula: abs_amount = amount / pow(10, decimal).</ResponseField>

### How do I query the minimum deposit amount for a specific coin?
   <Expandable title="Answer">
      <ResponseField >
      You can refer to the `minimum_deposit_threshold` field of the [GET /v1/custody/get_supported_coins/](https://www.cobo.com/developers/api-references/custody-wallet/get_supported_coins)
       endpoint to query the minimum deposit amount for a specific coin within a Custodial Wallet. If the response returns a zero, it indicates that the there is no minimum deposit requirement for the selected type of coins. Note that coins held under an MPC Wallet do not have any minimum deposit requirements.

### How to query the transaction details of a batch withdrawal request?
    <Expandable title="Answer">
        <ResponseField >
         You can use the [GET /v1/custody/transactions_by_request_ids/](https://www.cobo.com/developers/api-references/custody-wallet/transactions_by_request_ids) endpoint 
         to query the transaction details of a batch withdrawal request submitted under a Custodial Wallet. The request IDs should be provided in the `request_ids` field of the GET request, separated by commas. 
         For an MPC Wallet, you can use the [GET /v1/custody/mpc/transactions_by_request_ids/](https://www.cobo.com/developers/api-references/mpc-wallet/mpc_transactions_by_request_ids) endpoint instead. A maximum of 50 request IDs can be included in a single request.

### How do I query the details of a pending transaction?
    <Expandable title="Answer">
        <ResponseField >
        You may use the [GET /v1/custody/pending_transactions/](https://www.cobo.com/developers/api-references/custody-wallet/pending_transactions) 
        endpoint to query the details of a pending transaction under a Custodial Wallet. For an MPC Wallet, you may refer to the `status` field with code 501 PENDING_CONFIRMATION in [any transactional APIs](https://www.cobo.com/developers/api-references/mpc-wallet/mpc_list_transactions) to retrieve the details of a pending transaction. 
        Prior to using any endpoints, however, you need to first head to Cobo Custody Web and enable the "Transaction Notification - Includes Block Confirmation Number" Status feature. 
        Failure to enable this feature will result in the inability to fetch transaction information. For more information, please refer to  https://www.cobo.com/developers/api-references/development/transaction-notification. Do note that some transactions cannot be retrieved due to fast on-chain confirmations (e.g., TRON).

## API Key
### How can I obtain the public and private API keys?
<Expandable title="Answer">
      <ResponseField >
      Cobo employs the ECDSA algorithm for signature verification. We strongly recommend that you generate your public and private API keys locally to ensure that Cobo neither has access to nor stores your private keys. After generating your keys locally, you can manage the public keys by heading to Cobo Custody Web-Wallet-API. For more information on private key generation, signing and verification, please refer to https://github.com/CoboGlobal/. For API references, please go to https://www.cobo.com/developers/api-references/overview/authentication.

### Why cannot I add an API key on Cobo Custody Web?
<Expandable title="Answer">
      <ResponseField >
      Only the admin is authorized to add API keys on Cobo Custody Web. Please contact your admin if you don't have the permission 
      </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>

### Why did my API signature verification fail?
<Expandable title="Answer">
      <ResponseField >
      Your API signature verification may have failed due to the following reasons: 

The public keys are not associated with the correct environments (i.e., production, development) on Cobo Custody Web. 

Incorrect API key types. Please make sure that you are using the correct key type (i.e., "querying", "withdrawal and querying", "operation and querying").

The incorrect HOST has been used. 
- Development: https://api.develop.cobo.com; corresponding Cobo Custody Web page: https://home.develop.cobo.com/.
- Production: https://api.custody.cobo.com; corresponding Cobo Custody Web page: https://home.custody.cobo.com/. 
 
If the issue still persists, please provide us with the parameters and return values for troubleshooting.

### Do all API keys have a validity period of 90 days?
<Expandable title="Answer">
      <ResponseField >
      If an API key is not associated with an IP whitelist, its validity period is limited to 90 days. However, once an IP address is added to the API key, it becomes permanently valid.
      </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>


## API Callback 
### Do I need to verify a callback?
<Expandable title="Answer">
      <ResponseField >
      For security reasons, we highly recommend that you complete the signature verification and IP whitelisting when receiving Cobo's callback messages. You can obtain Cobo's pubkey by heading to Cobo Custody Web-Wallet-API Callback. For more information on signature verification, refer to https://www.cobo.com/developers/api-references/development/callback-signature.
      </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>

### How many times can an API callback notification be pushed?
<Expandable title="Answer">
      <ResponseField >
      Each API callback can be pushed for a maximum of 14 times. The time intervals between each push are incremental, starting at 10-minute intervals and progressively extending to hourly, bi-hourly, and so forth.
      </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>

### Why do I need to configure API callback confirmation?
<Expandable title="Answer">
      <ResponseField >
      Given the potential single-point failure risks associated with API servers, we strongly recommend that you maintain a dedicated callback server for configuring API callback confirmation. This not only enhances risk isolation but also facilitates effective internal security control. In the event of an exception during API callback confirmation, Cobo's 24/7 customer support will provide you with real-time alerts, enabling immediate internal inspection to address any potential security vulnerabilities.
