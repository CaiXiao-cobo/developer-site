### How do I query the withdrawal fees?
    <Expandable title="Answer">
        <ResponseField >
         The withdrawal fees may fluctuate based on how busy a blockchain network is. You can refer to the `abs_estimate_fee` field
          of the [GET /v1/custody/coin_info](/api-references/custody-wallet/coin_info) endpoint to check the estimated withdrawal fees associated with a Custodial Wallet.
          For an MPC Wallet, please use the [GET /v1/custody/mpc/estimate_fee/](/api-references/mpc-wallet/mpc_estimate_fee) endpoint instead.

### What do `amount` and `abs_amount` stand for in the interface?
<Expandable title="Answer">
   <ResponseField >In the realm of cryptocurrencies, each coin possesses a smallest unit.
   For instance, a satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Each Bitcoin equals 100 million satoshis (i.e., 100,000,000).
   Cobo denominates amount in terms of the smallest unit specific to each cryptocurrency to prevent complications associated with the misuse of floating point numbers.
   If you transfer 1 Bitcoin, for instance, the `amount` will be displayed as 100,000,000 and the `abs_amount` will be 1.
   This conversion is calculated using the formula: abs_amount = amount / pow(10, decimal).</ResponseField>

### How do I query the minimum deposit amount for a specific coin?
   <Expandable title="Answer">
      <ResponseField >
      You can refer to the `minimum_deposit_threshold` field of the [GET /v1/custody/get_supported_coins/](/api-references/custody-wallet/get_supported_coins)
       endpoint to query the minimum deposit amount for a specific coin within a Custodial Wallet. If the response returns a zero, it indicates that the there is no minimum deposit requirement for the selected type of coins. Note that coins held under an MPC Wallet do not have any minimum deposit requirements.
